               It’s an incontrovertible fact that the emergence of very large language models (VLLMs) has dramatically altered
               the trajectory of progress in the field of AI. With the release of ChatGPT, that excitement has now transcended
               boundaries from AI researchers to practitioners and even to the common man; indeed it asserts we are living in an
               exciting time of scientific proliferation. However, we see two opposing community views on VLLMs. A set of
               believers in the magical powers of VLLMs claim that VLLMs are autodidactic in that they learn a wide gamut of new
               capabilities – referred to as "emerging capabilities" in the community – an effect that gets pronounced with model
               size and dataset scale. On the other hand, critics are not yet prepared to acknowledge the self-learning power of
               VLLMs, they criticize it as only a statistical learner and point out several flaws – hallucination being the most
               prominent one. In this forum, we want to bring together both communities – the believers and the critics, and want
               to explore exciting tasks together: (i) CT2 - Counter Turing Test: AI-Generated Text Detection, and (ii) -
               HallucinatIon eLiciaTion through automatic detection and mitigation.Expect this to be an exciting forum to
               discuss, debate, and make new exciting scientific pathways for the future. This will be an one day workshop, we
               are expecting 60+ attendance, a website will be made once the proposal is accepted.

               Over the past couple of years, recent advancements in AI have led to AI systems become immensely more powerful
               than ever before. While their applications for social good cannot be overstated, as an unintended by-product,
               risks of misuse have also exacerbated. With this notion, an open petition letter [10] has been written (led by
               Gary Marcus) by the nonprofit Future of Life Institute, calling for all AI labs to immediately pause for at least
               6 months "moratorium" the training of AI systems more powerful than GPT-4. The letter has confirmed signatories
               (18K+, still counting) include the Turing Award-winning AI pioneer Yoshua Bengio and other leading AI researchers
               such as Stuart Russell. Others who joined include Elon Musk (SpaceX, Tesla, Twitter), Steve Wozniak (co-founder of
               Apple), former U.S. presidential candidate Andrew Yang and Rachel Bronson, president of the Bulletin of the Atomic
               Scientists, a science-oriented advocacy group known for its warnings against humanity-ending nuclear war. On the
               other hand, the opposing campaign which doesn’t believe in halting scientific progress has powerful people too,
               including Bill Gates (founder of Microsoft) [2], Andrew Ng (Stanford University, Coursera), Turing award winner
               Yann LeCun (NYU, Meta) and many others. Ng and LeCun released their opinions over a video podcast [20].

                      With the emergence of ChatGPT, the risk of AI-generated content has reached an alarming apocalypse. 
                      ChatGPT has been declared banned by the school system in NYC [15], Google ads [5], and Stack
                      Overflow [8], while scientific conferences like ACL [3] and ICML [4] have released new policies
                      deterring the usage of ChatGPT for scientific writing. After the initial scepticism, ChatGPT has
                      been seen as a listed author in scientific papers [6, 12], while Elsevier [empty citation] and ACM
                      [empty citation] have adopted more inclusive guidelines on the use of ChatGPT for scientific writing.
                      Indeed, detecting AI-generated text has suddenly emerged as a concern that needs immediate attention.
                      While watermarking as a potential solution to the problem is being studied by OpenAI [19], a handful
                      of systems that detect AI-generated text such as GPT-2 output detector [18], GLTR [16], GPTZero
                      [17], have recently been observed in practical use. To address the inevitable question of ownership
                      attribution for the generated artifacts, the US Copyright Office [13] released a statement stating that
                      if the content is traditional elements of authorship produced by a machine, the work lacks human
                      authorship and the office will not register it for copyright. Therefore, AI-generated text detection
                      is a topic that needs a thorough investigation. In this regard, there are three families of techniques
                      proposed so far:
                      <br/><br/>
                    <ul>
                      <li><b>Watermarking:</b> First introduced in [1], watermarking AI-generated text involves embedding an
                             imperceptible code or signal to verify the author of a particular text with certainty. OpenAI’s GPT
                             does this by selecting the next token pseudorandomly (rather than simply choosing the one with the
                             highest probability) using a cryptographic pseudorandom function whose key is only possessed by
                             OpenAI . It would be remiss not to mention the most obvious pitfall of this approach, which is that if
                             the text is altered or modified in any way, detecting the watermark proves to be a difficult task.</li>
                      <li><b>Negative log likelihood (NLL):</b> NLL-based implementations such as DetectGPT [11] have demon66 strated the
                             detection of AI-generated text by comparing log-likelihood of generated tokens after
                             perturbing the input text by replacing some tokens with others. If the new, perturbed version of
                             the text lies in the negative curvature regions of log-likelihood, it was likely generated by AI. The
                             limitation of this approach is that it requires access to the log probabilities of the text in order to
                             work which implies that knowledge of which LLM was used to generate the text is essential.</li>
                     <li><b>Perplexity and Burstiness:</b> GPTZero [17], an example of a detection technique based on perplexity
                            and burstiness, has demonstrated that a text with lower perplexity (a measure of how predictable
                            the text is), and with lower burstiness (the measure of how uniform text is) has a high probability
                            of being generated by an AI. The limitations here are that GPTZero also requires access to log
                            probabilities of text as well as the fact that it approximates perplexity values using a linear model.</li>
                     </ul>
                     <p>Although AI-generated text detection has suddenly received immense attention, Liang et al. [7]
                        suggest that available AI-generated text detectors consistently misclassify non-native English writing
                        samples as AI-generated, whereas native writing samples are accurately identified, highlighting the
                        ethical implications of deploying AI-generated content detectors and risking misrepresentation. This
                        implies that a community effort is needed to tackle the issue of detectors penalizing under-represented
                        sub-population(s). The CT2 task will be the first of its kind in bring together researchers in advancing. 
                        CT2 will consist of three sub-tasks. We will be releasing 500K data points, consisting of (i) prompt,(ii)
                        human-written text, and (iii) AI-generated text by 5 different LLMs.</p>
                     <br/><br/>
                     <ul>
                     <li><b>Task A:</b> given a set of human-generated text documents vs. AI-generated text documents participants
                            need to design techniques to detect AI-generated text. Indeed, human-written text vs. AI-generated
                            text would be parallel, which means they will be on the same topic. In this task, we will let
                            participants know that the generated text is from GPT, OPT, BERT, XLNet, etc. As such, this is an
                            LLM-specific AI-detection task.</li>
                     <li><b>Task B:</b> in this task, we will not tell people the generated text is using which LLM. Participants need
                            to design techniques which is LLM agnostic.</li>
                     <li><b>Task C:</b> In this task, we will offer AI-assisted writing, i.e., AI-generated text interlaced with minor
                            edits by another language model and human, as input. Given the intricacies and challenges of
                            AI-assisted writing, it would be the hardest task to attempt.</li>
                    </ul>
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      With the recent and rapid advances in the areas of LLMs and Generative AI, the pre-eminent and
                      ubiquitous concern is of hallucination. We release a large-scale first of its kind human-annotated data
                      with detailed annotations on - intrinsic vs. extrinsic hallucinations, and degree of hallucination, and
                      we ask participants to come up with either black-box factuality Assessment and/or evidence-based
                      fact-checking. First, we define categories of hallucinations:
                      <br/><br/>
                      <ul>
                        <li><b>Intrinsic Hallucination:</b>The generated output that contradicts the source content. For instance, in
                               the abstractive summarization task from Table 1, the generated summary “The first Ebola vaccine
                               was approved in 2021” contradicts the source content “The first vaccine for Ebola was approved by
                               the FDA in 2019.”</li>
                        <li><b>Extrinsic Hallucination:</b>The generated output that cannot be verified from the source content
                               (i.e., output that can neither be supported nor contradicted by the source). As an example, in the
                               abstractive summarization task from Table 1 *which table 1?*, the information “China has already
                               started clinical trials of the COVID-19 vaccine.” is not mentioned in source. We can neither find
                               evidence for the generated output from the source nor assert that it is wrong. Notably, the extrinsic
                               hallucination is not always erroneous because it could be from factually correct external information
                               [125, 181]. Such factual hallucination can be helpful because it recalls additional background
                               knowledge to improve the informativeness of the generated text. However, in most of the literature,
                               extrinsic hallucination is still treated with caution because its unverifiable aspect of this additional
                               information increases the risk from a factual safety perspective.</li>
                        </ul>
                         <p> Next, based on the <b>degree of hallucination</b>, we categorize it into three levels: </p>
                         <br/>
                        <ul>
                        <li><b>Mild:</b>At this level, hallucination can be categorized as minor and the generated output may just
                               contain innocuous errors or inconsistencies in text. The generated text will not significantly impact
                               it’s coherence.</li>
                        <li><b>Moderate:</b>Moderate hallucination will involve more significant errors or distortions in the generated
                               text. The text may contain nonsensical phrases or ideas that deter from the topic at hand. </li>
                        <li><b>Alarming:</b>Alarming hallucinations in LLM entail a drastic deviation from the intended output.
                               Such deviations can also be offensive and are incongruous to the desired output.</li>
                        </ul>
                          <p><b>Detection Methods</b></p>
                          <br/>
                        <ul>
                        <li><b>Black-box factuality assessment:</b>Black-box hallucination detection approaches, such as Self130 CheckGPT
                               [9], endeavor to fact-check models without utilizing an external database of facts. In
                               the case of SelfCheckGPT, it has the capacity to fact-check models in a zero-resource fashion by
                               evaluating if the generated facts have similarity or if they contradict each other.</li>
                       <li><b>Evidence-based fact checking:</b>Evidence based fact checking, such as LLM-Augmenter [14],
                              leverage the use of task-specific databases or similar reliable resources that contain the accurate facts.</li>
                        </ul>
